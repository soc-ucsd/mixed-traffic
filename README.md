# Modeling and Control of Mixed Traffic Flow

In this project, we investigate dynamical modeling and fundamental properties for ring-road mixed traffic systems with Connected and Autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). The control policies CAVs are designed with a system-level consideration in terms of

1. dissipating traffic waves 
2. improving the performance of the entire mixed traffic flow. 

In particular, we demonstrate three important topics in mixed traffic flow.

* [Topic 1: Smoothing Traffic Flow via Autonomous Vehicles](#Topic-1)
* [Topic 2: Structured Optimal Control of Autonomous Vehicles](#Topic-2)
* [Topic 3: Cooperative Formation of Multiple Autonomous Vehicles: beyond platooning](#Topic-3)

To run the code, the Modeling package, [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/), and the optimization solver, [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/), are needed to solve the semidefinite program in controller synthesis.


## Topic 1: Smoothing Traffic Flow via Autonomous Vehicles <a name="Topic-1"></a>

Although large-scale numerical simulations and small-scale experiments have shown promising results, a comprehensive theoretical understanding to smooth traffic flow via AVs is lacking. Here, from a control-theoretic perspective, we establish analytical results on the **controllability**, **stabilizability**, and **reachability** of a mixed traffic system consisting of HDVs and AVs in a ring road.

A schematic diagram for the mixed traffic system is as follows.

## Topic 2: Structured Optimal Control of Autonomous Vehicles <a name="Topic-2"></a>

Due to the limited communication abilities in practice, the CAV can only receive partial information on the global traffic system for its feedback. Therefore, it is important to consider the **local available information** of the neighboring vehicles. This leads to the notion of **structured controller design**.

Here is an illustration of structured constraints under limited communication abilities.

## Topic 3: Cooperative Formation of Multiple Autonomous Vehicles: beyond platooning <a name="Topic-3"></a>

In mixed traffic flow, the prevailing platooning of multiple AVs is not the only choice for cooperative formation. We re-design the control strategies of AVs in different formations and investigate the optimal formation of multiple AVs using a set-function optimization perspective. Two predominant optimal formations, i.e., **uniform distribution** and **platoon formation**, emerge from extensive numerical experiments.
